#The second parameter to this recursive function must be a directory name-eliminating pattern (more than just "%").
#Passing just "%" as the second parameter will result in non-leaves (directories) getting concatenated without
#delimiting spaces.  Solving this with a space between the "filter" and "call" functions was avoided because this
#causes extra whitespace in the output file list.
recursiveFilter = ${foreach var,${wildcard ${1}*},${filter ${2},${var}}${call recursiveFilter,${var}/,${2}}}
